Phone Number Word Mapper
This C program converts a 7-digit phone number (excluding digits 0 and 1) into all possible alphabetical word combinations using the classic telephone keypad layout. It then checks if any of these combinations (full 7-letter words or 3+4 splits) exist in a dictionary file (dict.txt). Valid words are printed to the console and all combinations are written to output.txt.
